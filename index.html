      <h1>Aadi Shah</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        I’m a mechanical engineering student at the University of Southern California
        with a minor in business finance. I’m interested in building real hardware systems
        that have to work outside of controlled environments and under real operational
        constraints.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        I’m originally from Singapore, and growing up there has shaped many of the
        problems I’m interested in—dense cities, high infrastructure demands, and systems
        that need to function reliably despite environmental and logistical challenges.
      </p>

  <!-- WHAT I WORK ON -->
  <h2>What I Work On</h2>

  <p>
    Most of my work revolves around hands-on mechanical design and hardware system
    integration. I enjoy projects where hardware decisions meaningfully affect
    performance, reliability, and user behavior.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mechanical design and CAD (SolidWorks, Siemens NX)</li>
    <li>Hardware-focused system integration</li>
    <li>Rapid prototyping and 3D printing</li>
    <li>Designing for deployment, maintenance, and failure modes</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CURRENT PROJECTS -->
  <h2>What I’m Currently Building</h2>

  <p>
    I’m currently working on a hardware startup project focused on 3D-printed,
    weather-capable drones for traffic monitoring in India. The goal is to build
    platforms that can operate reliably during monsoon seasons, where rain, wind,
    humidity, and poor visibility cause most off-the-shelf systems to fail.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside this, I stay involved in aircraft, vehicle, and propulsion-related
    projects to continue building system-level intuition—from conceptual aircraft
    design to drivetrain and autonomous vehicle work.
  </p>

  <!-- INTERESTS -->
  <h2>Outside of Work</h2>

  <p>
    Outside of engineering, I spend a lot of time around vehicles and outdoors. I’m a
    big car and aviation enthusiast, and I enjoy understanding how complex mechanical
    systems behave under real operating conditions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Road biking and staying active at the gym</li>
    <li>Cars, planes, and Formula 1</li>
    <li>Hiking and spending time outdoors</li>
    <li>Cooking and experimenting with food in my free time</li>
  </ul>
