  <h1>Autonomous Vehicle Design Project (King of the Hill)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Design Lead · March 2024 – May 2024</div>

  <p>
    This project involved the design and construction of a small autonomous vehicle
    built to compete in a torque- and speed-driven hill-climbing challenge. The vehicle
    was required to repeatedly climb a steep incline under dynamic load conditions while
    maintaining mechanical reliability.
  </p>

  <p>
    My focus was on mechanical system design and integration rather than advanced autonomy.
    The project emphasized real-world constraints such as drivetrain alignment, structural
    stiffness, wiring robustness, and repeatable performance under repeated testing.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and reinforced a wooden chassis to reduce flex under high torque loads</li>
    <li>Optimized placement of motors, battery, Arduino, and sensors for stability and accessibility</li>
    <li>Improved drivetrain alignment to reduce mechanical losses and inconsistent behavior</li>
    <li>Debugged performance issues caused by wiring movement, voltage drop, and mounting flexibility</li>
    <li>Tuned Arduino control logic once mechanical reliability was achieved</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design Focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mechanical robustness under dynamic loading</li>
    <li>Drivetrain consistency and alignment</li>
    <li>System-level integration of mechanical and electrical components</li>
    <li>Iterative debugging through physical testing</li>
  </ul>
